This is a repository for a web app developed to break down song genre composition. The Jupyter Notebook is how the model was trained and altered as well as how the data itself was preprocessed.

Unfortunately, the web app requires too many resources to run on the free tier for most web hosting services. As of now, the only way to run it is to download the repository and run it locally yourself.
